# Introduction 

The linear power supply ensures a consistent output voltage unaffected
by varying loads. Power supplies play a crucial role in delivering
continuous voltage and current to connected devices. When designing a
power supply, factors such as efficiency, load, line regulation, and
short circuit protection are taken into account. This project involves
the creation of a voltage regulator from scratch, intended to power a
high-load (100W) with a 15V input voltage. The primary objective is to
construct a linear power supply capable of delivering a stable 10V
output with a maximum current of 10A, incorporating circuit protection
to prevent short circuits and over-current, all while optimizing power
supply efficiency. The operational principle of a linear power supply
entails transforming the input voltage, rectifying and filtering it, and
then regulating it to provide a consistent and accurate output voltage
for electronic devices.

## Rectification

Rectification involves the conversion of AC voltage into DC voltage.
Initially, the AC voltage from the power source undergoes a reduction in
the transformer, lowering it to a suitable level (230V rms -15V rms) for
the power supply. Then AC voltage is directed to a diode bridge
comprising four diodes arranged in a specific configuration.

<figure>
<img src="Bridge.png" id="fig:example" style="width:10cm" alt="Bridge Rectifier" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Bridge Rectifier</figcaption>
</figure>

From the output of the rectifier, we can get a pulsating DC voltage
V\_out,  
V\_out = V\_in(peak) - 2V\_d  
V\_out = 15V - 1.1V = 20.11V  
PIV = V\_in(peak) - V\_d = 20.51V

Since PIV of BR3510 bridge rectifier is 1000V, it is sufficient for this
design.

## Voltage Regulation

<figure>
<img src="Regulation.png" id="fig:example" style="width:10cm" alt="Voltage Regulator" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">Voltage Regulator</figcaption>
</figure>

Voltage regulation mechanism is used to provide a constant voltage at
the output despite the variation of the load. Here we have used TIP 142
darlington power transistor (Q1). The regulation is improved and ripple
voltage reduced by the addition of a pre-regulator circuit. This
additional circuitry consists of Q2, R6, R2 and Z1. It will provide a
constant current of reduced ripple to the collector of Q3 and hence to
the base of Q1. The zener diode Z1 will hold the base voltage of Q2
fixed, and the negative feedback voltage developed across R6 will tend
to keep the collector current constant. Q2 and Q3 are selected as a
complementary pair. Overall negative feedback is applied through Q3,
R13, R8 and R14. Biasing current for D4 flows through R9, R10, R12. It’s
noise is reduce by the filters implemented by C2 and C3 capacitors.

## Smoothing

In PSU, smoothing technique is employed to mitigate ripple voltage or
noise in the DC output voltage. This approach incorporates a capacitor
filter to smooth the pulsating DC voltage generated by the rectification
circuit, resulting in a more consistent and stable DC voltage output.
The capacitor filter comprises capacitors connected in parallel with the
load circuit. In the peaks of the pulsating DC voltage produced by the
rectification circuit, the capacitor accumulates charge up to the peak
voltage. Conversely, during the declining phase of the pulsating
voltage, the capacitor discharges its stored charge, ensuring a
continuous and steady current flow to the load circuit. The amount of
smoothing or ripple reduction provided by the capacitor filter is
dependent on the value of the capacitor. Which is calculated as follows,

  
V\_ripple(pp) \< V\_out - 10V = 10.11V

  
V\_ripple(pp) = $\\frac{V\_{p(rect)}}{c\\times f\\times R\_{L}}$

  
R\_(min) = = = 1 Ohm

  
10.11 \> $\\frac{20.11}{c\\times 100\\times 1}$

  
c \> 19.89 mF

From calculation we have found that 19.89 mF is required for expected
ripple reduction. But during prototyping we have discovered that 14.1 mF
is sufficient for ripple reduction as well as maintaining smaller
transient current. Therefore we have used three 4.7 mF capacitors
parallel to the output. Additional 4.7mF capacitor is placed parallel to
the regulatory circuit in order to reduce the ripple in the input of
regulatory circuit.

## Circuit Protection

Over - voltage protection is implemented using a varistor at the input
of the circuit. This varistor is capable of protecting the circuit at
surges. For over - current protection we have used 12A Fuse. It is
capable of withstanding a maximum current of 12A. Hence, the fuse will
burn prevent any harm to the circuit when the input current exceeds 12A.
Additionally, we have implemented a current limiter using BC 547
transistor (Q4) and 0.22 Ohm resisters. After testing we have discovered
that 0.044 Ohm is required for current limiter to function while
maintaining a minimal voltage drop. Therefore five 0.22 Ohm 5W resistors
are connected parallel to each other.  
In our design, bridge rectifier and the darlington transistor generate
the majority of the heat. Due to the design of the bridge rectifier,
passive cooling is sufficient to maintain it under operation
temperature. On the other hand, the darlington transistor require active
cooling solution. Therefore a cooling fan integrated with a heat sink is
used.

# Component Selection

1.  Bridge Rectifier - BR3510 bridge rectifier was chosen as it has
    voltage range of 50V to 1000V as well as 35A current. It’s 1000V
    surge rating as well as 400A surge current ensures the protection
    against surges. Finally it’s superior thermal design ensures that
    passive cooling is sufficient to maintain it under operating
    temperature.

2.  Darlington Transistor - TIP 142 Darlington Complementary Silicon
    Power Transistor is used for regulatory circuitry. It is capable of
    operating in the range of 60 to 100 V and 125W load. Due to it’s
    high gain ( *h*<sub>*E**F*</sub> = 1000 ) regulatory circuit has
    managed to attain high efficiency. Also it’s packaging makes it
    easier to mount a heat sink.

3.  Smoothing Capacitors - As the circuit require a capacitance of
    14.1mF, we decided to use three electrolytic capacitors, each with a
    capacitance of 4.7mF. We specifically chose low ESR variant in order
    to minimize the voltage drop of the output at high load.

4.  Low resistance resistors - As the current limiter circuit require a
    resistance of 0.44 Ohm, we used five 0.22 Ohm 5W resister. 0.22 Ohm
    was the smallest available value in the local market. It’s power
    rating ensures that it can withstand high current.

5.  Variable resistors - We have use 1k and 10k trimmers to fine-tune
    the output after soldering. Due to compact size of these trimmers,
    they were able to fit into the PCB without taking up excessive
    space.

Rest of the components were selected based on required specifications,
availability in local market and cost.

# PCB Design

<figure>

</figure>

For the PCB, we have used 2 layer 2 Oz copper design where top layer is
used for power lines and signal lines and the bottom layer was used for
ground lines. Minimum trace width of 3.6mm is maintained for all power
lines. Copper polygons are used in top and bottom layers.They provide a
lower resistance path for current flow, reducing power loss and voltage
drop. Adequate clearance and spacing between components and traces are
maintained, in order to prevent shorts and interference as well as to
meet production capabilities. PCB was designed using Altium and produced
by JLC PCB.

# Enclosure Design

Enclosure was designed in order to have sufficient space for PCB and the
cooling mechanisms. Air intake vent was placed at the back of the
enclosure and two exhaust vents were placed at the sides. Power input
and the fuse were placed at the back. Power output, power switch and
indicator LED were placed at the front. 0.5mm sheet metal was used make
light weight enclosure while maintaining structural integrity. Two part
design was made in order to provide access to interior easily.

#  Future Works

Efficiency of the PSU can be further enhanced by integrating a dynamic
cooling system. It will control the speed of cooling fan according to
the system temperature. Also a LCD display can be mounted in the front
provide information such as current and voltage to user.
